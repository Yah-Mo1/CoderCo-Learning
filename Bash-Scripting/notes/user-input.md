### User Input in Bash Scripting

In Bash scripting, user input is commonly captured using the `read` command, which allows the script to prompt the user for data and store that input into variables. This makes your script interactive, allowing users to provide input during execution.

### 1. **Using the `read` Command for User Input**

The `read` command is used to accept user input and store it in a variable.

#### Syntax:

```bash
read variable_name
```

#### Example: Simple User Input

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask the user for their name
echo "What is your name?"
read name

# Greet the user
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

### Explanation:

- The script asks the user for their name using `echo`.
- The `read` command waits for user input and stores the input in the variable `name`.
- The script then greets the user with the input name.

### Output (assuming the user enters "Alice"):

```
What is your name?
Alice
Hello, Alice!
```

### 2. **Prompting the User with a Custom Message**

You can provide a custom prompt message while asking for user input by using `echo` and `read` together.

#### Example: Custom Prompt

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask the user for their age with a custom prompt
read -p "Please enter your age: " age

# Display the input
echo "You are $age years old."
```

### Explanation:

- The `-p` flag with `read` allows you to specify a prompt message directly on the same line as the input.

### Output (assuming the user enters "25"):

```
Please enter your age: 25
You are 25 years old.
```

### 3. **Reading Multiple Inputs**

You can read multiple inputs in a single `read` command by separating them with spaces. Each input will be stored in separate variables.

#### Example: Multiple Inputs in One Line

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Ask the user for their first and last name
read -p "Enter your first and last name: " first_name last_name

# Display the input
echo "Hello, $first_name $last_name!"
```

### Explanation:

- The `read` command takes two inputs (`first_name` and `last_name`), and stores them in the respective variables.
- The user can input both values on the same line, separated by a space.

### Output (assuming the user enters "John Doe"):

```
Enter your first and last name: John Doe
Hello, John Doe!
```

### 4. **Reading Input with a Timeout**

You can specify a timeout for the `read` command to stop waiting for input after a certain period.

#### Example: Timeout for User Input

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user with a 5-second timeout
read -t 5 -p "You have 5 seconds to enter your name: " name

# Check if the user entered something
if [ -z "$name" ]; then
    echo "No input received within the timeout!"
else
    echo "Hello, $name!"
fi
```

### Explanation:

- The `-t` option allows you to set a timeout in seconds (5 seconds in this case).
- If the user doesn't provide input within 5 seconds, the script will proceed with a message indicating that no input was received.

### Output (if the user doesn't provide input within 5 seconds):

```
You have 5 seconds to enter your name:
No input received within the timeout!
```

### 5. **Reading Password Input (Hidden Input)**

To read sensitive information like a password, you can use the `-s` option with `read`, which hides the input on the screen.

#### Example: Reading Password

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt for a password
read -sp "Enter your password: " password
echo  # To add a newline after the hidden input

# Display a message (without showing the password)
echo "Password entered successfully."
```

### Explanation:

- The `-s` flag ensures that the userâ€™s input (such as a password) is not displayed on the terminal.
- The `echo` after the `read` command adds a newline since `-s` suppresses the newline.

### Output (after the user enters the password):

```
Enter your password:
Password entered successfully.
```

### 6. **Validating User Input**

You can validate user input using `if` statements or loops to ensure the input meets certain criteria.

#### Example: Input Validation (Number Check)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for a number
read -p "Enter a number between 1 and 10: " number

# Validate the input
if [[ $number -ge 1 && $number -le 10 ]]; then
    echo "You entered a valid number: $number"
else
    echo "Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 10."
fi
```

### Explanation:

- The script checks whether the input is a number between 1 and 10 using the `[[ $number -ge 1 && $number -le 10 ]]` condition.
- If the input is valid, it prints the number; otherwise, it asks the user to enter a valid number.

### Output (if the user enters "5"):

```
Enter a number between 1 and 10: 5
You entered a valid number: 5
```

If the user enters "15":

```
Enter a number between 1 and 10: 15
Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 10.
```

### 7. **Reading Input in a Loop Until Valid**

You can also loop until the user provides valid input, which is useful for scenarios where you need to enforce certain criteria.

#### Example: Loop for Valid Input

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Loop until valid input is entered
while true; do
    read -p "Enter a valid number between 1 and 10: " number
    if [[ $number -ge 1 && $number -le 10 ]]; then
        echo "You entered a valid number: $number"
        break
    else
        echo "Invalid input. Please try again."
    fi
done
```

### Explanation:

- The `while true` loop ensures the prompt repeats until the user enters a valid number.
- Once a valid input is provided, the loop is terminated using `break`.

### Output (if the user enters "3" after invalid entries):

```
Enter a valid number between 1 and 10: 15
Invalid input. Please try again.
Enter a valid number between 1 and 10: 3
You entered a valid number: 3
```

### Summary of Key Concepts:

- **`read` Command**: Used to capture user input and store it in a variable.
- **`-p` Option**: Allows you to provide a prompt directly with the `read` command.
- **Multiple Inputs**: Multiple inputs can be read in a single `read` command.
- **Timeout**: Use the `-t` option to specify a timeout for waiting for user input.
- **Hidden Input**: Use the `-s` option to hide user input (useful for passwords).
- **Validation**: You can validate user input to ensure it meets certain conditions (e.g., numeric ranges).
- **Loops for Input Validation**: You can use loops to repeatedly prompt the user until valid input is provided.

These features make user interaction in Bash scripts flexible and robust, allowing you to gather information from users in various formats.
