Variables are containers that hold data (such as strings, numbers, booleans etc)

To create a variable:
assign a value to it using assignment operator
e.g greeting="Hello World!"
To access this variable, you prepend the variable name with the "$" sign.

Variables can also be assigned to different data types:
Example:
count = 213
fruits = ("banana", "orange", "pineapple") --> arrays using close brackets

string/variable interpolation

name = "Yahya"
echo "Hello, $name" --> prints Hello Yahya
