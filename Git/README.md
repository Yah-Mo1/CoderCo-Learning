# CoderCo-Learning: Git Basics

Why Git?

Git is a version control system (VCS) that helps manage code changes over time. It records the history of changes, showing who made them, what was changed, when, and where. This system is crucial for tracking, collaborating, and reverting projects to previous states when needed.

# Centralized vs. Distributed Version Control

Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS): Developers connect to a central server to access the latest code and share their changes. Example: SVN.
Drawback: A single point of failureâ€”if the server goes offline, collaboration stops.
Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): Each developer has a full copy of the project and its history on their machine. This allows offline work and synchronization when needed. Example: Git.

# Benefits of Using Git

Free and open-source
Extremely fast and scalable
Cost-effective, especially for branching and merging

TODO: We will use this newly created readme to complete the git assignment below:

1. Create a feature branch: Do your changes on a new Git branch, following
   best practices for naming (e.g., feature/script-enhancements).
2. Creative Changes: Implement creative, significant improvements or new
   features in your BASH scripts.
3. Make meaningful commits: Ensure that your commits are properly formatted
   with descriptive messages.
4. Create a Merge Request (MR): Once your changes are complete, submit an
   MR. I will be added as a reviewer to ensure proper Git practices are followed
   and to review the creativity of your changes.
