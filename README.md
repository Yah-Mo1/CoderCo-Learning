## üåü What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a cultural and technical movement that bridges the gap between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). By fostering collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery, DevOps empowers teams to build, test, and release software faster and with greater reliability.

A **DevOps Engineer** acts as the linchpin of this process. They are responsible for automating workflows, managing infrastructure as code, and ensuring seamless deployment pipelines. Whether it's optimizing cloud infrastructures, maintaining CI/CD pipelines, or orchestrating containerized applications, DevOps engineers are crucial in modern software development.
