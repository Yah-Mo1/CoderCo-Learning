üèÅ **Bandit Level 6 -> 7: Finding a File with Specific Ownership and Size**

üéØ **Level Objective**  
The password for Bandit Level 7 is stored in a file somewhere on the server with the following properties:

- Owned by user `bandit7`
- Owned by group `bandit6`
- 33 bytes in size

You need to locate this file, read its content, and retrieve the password.

üîß **Commands Required**

- `find`: Search for files within directories.
- `cat`: Display the contents of a file.
- `ssh`: A tool to securely connect to remote systems.
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppress error messages.

üßë‚Äçüíª **Step-by-Step Solution**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 1: Search for the File with the Required Properties**  
To find the file with the specified properties (size 33 bytes, owned by `bandit7`, and in the group `bandit6`), use the `find` command with the following flags:

- `-size 33c`: The file must be 33 bytes in size.
- `-user bandit7`: The file must be owned by the user `bandit7`.
- `-group bandit6`: The file must be owned by the group `bandit6`.
- `2>/dev/null`: Suppress error messages that occur when accessing files or directories you don‚Äôt have permission to view.

Command:  
find / -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 2: Examine the Output**  
The command will search the entire file system (`/`) and return the file that matches all the conditions. The output should look like this:

Output:  
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 3: Display the File Contents**  
Now that we know the location of the file (`/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password`), use the `cat` command to read its contents.

Command:  
cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password

Output:  
morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj

This is the password for Bandit Level 7.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 4: Log Into Bandit Level 7**  
Once you have the password, log out of the current session using `ctrl + D`, then use SSH to log into Bandit Level 7.

Command:  
ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted, enter the password `morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj`.

‚úÖ **Solution**  
To log in to Bandit Level 7, use the following command:

ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

When prompted, enter the password `morbNTDkSW6jIlUc0ymOdMaLnOlFVAaj`. You will now be logged into Bandit Level 7 and can proceed to the next challenge.

üîç **Thought Process Behind the Solution**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Search the entire server**: The key is to search the entire file system (`/`) to find the file, not just the current directory.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Refine the search**: The `find` command helps to narrow the search by specifying the file size, owner, and group.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Read the file**: Once the correct file is identified, use `cat` to display the password.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Log into the next level**: With the password in hand, use SSH to log into Bandit Level 7.
