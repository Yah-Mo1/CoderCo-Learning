üßë‚Äçüíª **Step-by-Step Solution**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Step 1: List Files**

- First, check the contents of the home directory using:
  ```bash
  ls
  You will see two files: passwords.old and passwords.new.
  2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Compare Files with diff
  ```

Use the diff command to compare the files while ignoring whitespace differences:
diff -w passwords.old passwords.new
The -w option ignores whitespace changes.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3: Analyze the Output

The output will look something like this:
42c42
< x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
